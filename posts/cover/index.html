I started playing around with Linux back in 2006 with\nYellow Dog Linux on my PS3. That quickly became an obsession and I started looking into all the\ndistros that were around and eventually I found Ubuntu. This was back when you could get on a\nlist and have someone mail you a physical copy of the OS. I still have my 9.04 and 10.04 disks\nfrom those days and keep them on my display shelf.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I had set up my first servers I was hooked. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what I wanted to do\nwith my life, but I knew I wanted to study Linux and work with it one day as a professional. I\nwent to Texas Christian University after I found that they had a program that was heavily\ninvolved in Linux and security. While I was there I decided to take a break my Jr year and\nfounded a startup company called \u0026ldquo;Sheepdog Technologies\u0026rdquo; with my roommate and some of\nmy friends from Boy Scouts.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe worked on an application for Google Glass to reinvent the tour guide experience with this\nnew technology and ibeacons. We ended up working with several museums and even had\nmembers from the Smithsonian and Travelocity on our board. I ran the company for about 3\nyears until the funding ended and we were unable to lock down a final source for our second\nround of investing. It was an amazing experience that led me to work with countless individuals\nfrom across the world and it helped me develop some of my interpersonal skills that I still use\nevery day.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Sheepdog Technologies ended I went back to TCU and completed my degree in Computer\nInformation Technology and walked away with a new and better understanding of everything\nLinux and security. This helped me land the job I\u0026rsquo;m at currently as a Linux Engineer for iFAX\nSolutions. We help our clients install, maintain, integrate, and troubleshoot HylaFAX Enterprise\non CentOS and RHEL servers.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHylaFAX Enterprise is a faxing solution that is used by countless enterprise organizations such\nas Twitter, FBI, Red Hat, etc. In addition to the large organizations it\u0026rsquo;s also commonly installed in\nmedical environments such as hospitals, pharmacys, or doctors offices. I\u0026rsquo;m also proud that my\ncurrent job can have a direct impact on the people in the medical field who rely on faxing to\nsubmit prescriptions or COVID test results.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love what I do currently and tell everyone how amazing it is to have a job where I spend all day\nworking on an open source software running on a Linux distro.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/span\u003e", "activity-content", contentDelay);
